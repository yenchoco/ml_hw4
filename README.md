Build a CNN from scratch.

## basic part
Train the self-built CNN model on Chest X-rays images dataset attached, and classify if the test cases is illed.

## advanced part
Build a model with the same structure as that in the basic part, but by Tensorflow instead.
Compare the accuracy rate, f1 score, training time difference betwwen self-built model and Tensorflow built one.
